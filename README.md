# Capstone Project - Globo Play Scraper

![App Demo](https://gph.is/g/Z8BB60k)

First of all, you can find this project's requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Build-your-own-scraper-f54eaca54d8a4d758a5f0141468127a8). The video presentation can be found [here](zoom).

In this project I:

- Used Ruby to implement a [Globo Play](https://globoplay.globo.com) search results scraper;
- Used HTML and CSS to create output pages with the results;
- Used the following gems: Nokogiri, Rubocop, Watir and Webdrivers;
- Set up a code linter in the repository;
- Used Github flow;
- Used RSpec to make the test examples for class methods;
- Created an effective Ruby code that solved my problem;
- Applied Ruby coding best practices;
- Implemented basic OOP principles;
- Have an organized project structure;
- Used common Ruby patterns;
- Chose a simple solution over a more complex one.

# What it does

When the App is executed, the user is prompted to type keywords. Then the App will search in [Globo Play](https://globoplay.globo.com) and create an HTML file with all of the results found!

## Built with

Ruby, HTML and CSS

## Live Demo

Not avaiable at the moment, it will be in here a future feature.

## Getting Started

- Clone the project to your local machine;
- `cd` into the project directory;
- Run `./bin/main.rb` in your terminal;
- Type the keywords you want to search (e.g. "The Big Bang Theory");
- Wait and watch the App running;
- There are two possible outputs;
- If there are no results, the output will be "No results!";
- If the App found results, go to the `/results` directory in the root;
- In `/results` the App will create one directory for each keyword you search;
- Enter any of these directories and open the .html file with a browser to see a list of results!
